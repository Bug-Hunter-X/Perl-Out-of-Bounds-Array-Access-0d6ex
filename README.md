This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an element of an array that is out of bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles potential out-of-bounds access.  The error can lead to unexpected results or program crashes. The solution uses a check to ensure the index is within the valid range.
